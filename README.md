# Git branching and commit message conventions
1. Always make use of a standard format, for example, while working on lets say ticket AS-10, we simply create a branch 
named AS-10-title-of-the-ticket or AS-10-meaningful-ticket-label
2. Git commit messages for that branch,
  when adding a new file should be --> [#10] ADD: This is a sample commit message
  when updating an existing file should be --> [#10] UPDATE: This is a sample commit message
  when deleting a file should be --> [#10] DELETE: This is a sample commit message
3. Hotfixes should be grouped under a hotfix group. So creating a branch will look like hotfix/AS-10-meaningful-ticket-label
4. Same structuring for Release branches. Same structure for commit messages as explained above.
